########## PROBABILITY ##########

## Probability Theory: Mathematical foundation of statistical inference 
## which is indespensible for analysing data affected by charts, 
## essential for data scientist.

## We will try to understand the financial crisis in early 2000s.
## need to ounderstand basics of probability.

## Examples such as random variable, independence, monte carlo simulation, 
## expected values, standard errors and central limit theorem.

## These statictical concepts as fundemental for statistical test.
## Statistical influence

## OVERVIEW: dealing with discrete probability, continuous probability 
## random variables, sampling models and central limit theorem
########
## discrete probability: basic principles of probability related 
##                       to categorical data. Exp, card games
## continuous probability: basic principles of probability related 
##                         to numeric and continuous data
## random variable: numeric outcomes resulting from random processes
## central limit theorem: which applies to large sample sizes

## BIG SHORT ##
## how interest rates are determined and some bad assumptions lead to crisis in

######## SECTION 1 #######
## Discrete probability
## 3 main parts:
## -intro
## -combinations and permutation
## -addition rule and Monti Hole

## section 1.1
## apply basic probability theory to categorical data
## section 1.2
## perform a Monte Carlo simulation to approximate the results of repeating and
#  experiment over and over, includig simulating the outcomes in the Montyhall
#  problem
## section 1.3
## distinguish between sampling with and without replacements, events that are
#  and are not independent, and combinations and combinations
## section 1.4
## apply the multiplications and addition rules as appropriate to calculate the 
#  probable of multiple events occurring


#### DISCRETE PROBABILITy ####
## Start with basic principles to categorical data.
## The subset of probability will help us understand the probability theory
#  for numeric and continuous data

## exp, 2 red beads and 3 blue beads of urn, what's the probability of picking a red one?
## 2/5
## 2 satisfy the condition necessary for the event as each of the 5 outcomes
#  has the same chance of occurring.
## As a more tangible way to think about the probability of the events as a 
#  proportion of times the event occurs when we repeat the experiment 
#  independently under the same conditions.

## We use the notation probability of A to denote the probability 
## we use the very general event to refer to when something happens by chance


## 100 likely voter at random, 48 democrates, 52 republicans
## we'll often deal with continuous variables
## events like is this person taller than 6 feet...
## exp: x >= 6, Pr(A) [probability of A]
## What;s an event: an outcome that can occur when something happens by chance
## What's probability of event: proportion of times the event had 
##                               occurred when we repeat the event 
## discrete variables (picking red bead)
## continuous variables (height over 6 ft)
